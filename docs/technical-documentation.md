# Assignment 1 - Personal Portfolio
A simple, responsive personal portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site highlights an intro, projects, skills, and a contact form.

## Project description
This portfolio showcases my well-understanding and background in the concept of web development in a clean, minimal layout:
- **Intro** with interactive buttons to navigate to the projects and contact sections
- **About** section with a brief bio
- **Skills** section listing key tools and strengths
- **Projects** grid with example projects mixed between personal and academic work
- **Contact** section with a client-side validated form (no backend)
- **Used technologies:** HTML, CSS, and a JS file.

**Structure:**
